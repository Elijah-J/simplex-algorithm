# Simplex Algorithm
Implementation of the simplex algorithm, a classical algorithm in linear optimization. 
Able to detect unbounded and infeasible datasets. Able to perform the two-phase simplex algorithm.

# Usage
Working directory must obtain the following three files:
  * A.csv - matrix representing system coefficients
  * b.csv - vector containing constraints
  * c.csv - objective function

# What I learned
* How to use NumPy; implemented various NumPy functions and objects
* Became more competent with Python objects and syntax
* How to parse a .csv file using NumPy
